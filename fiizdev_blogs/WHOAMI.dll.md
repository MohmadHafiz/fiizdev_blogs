hello, world! this is my first blog exclude the [Welcome](https://fiizdev.com/blog/post/Welcome) blog, so here where I'm gonna introduce myself, my name mohmad hafiz, live in **Brunei Darussalam**. i really interested in Information Technology mostly in cybersecurity part where i like being offensive, it's been 10-9 years that i experience in cybersecurity mostly in finding vulnerability on IoT devices such as router, dvr, webapp, etc. while in my actual life outside cybersecurity I'm a college student taking **IT Networking** in **Politeknik Brunei**, i don't have any favorite sports except Frisbee just for fun, i like going outside the country exploring other country and experience the foods and interesting places

talking about experience cybersecurity, because this blog gonna post more about hacking and stuff. yeah my first experience in hacking was accessing someone computer through RDP it was 9-10 years ago, this computer is exposed to internet and it use guest as login then what makes me more interested into hacking was from a Germany movie it is about orphan kid that live with his grandma that know about hacking and joining hacking club somehow got into problem with elite hacker, this movie called "**WHO AM I**" it is really good movie.

the best "hacking" year for me was 2017 because i learn a lot of stuff, remember "**SHADOWBROKER**" that leak NSA tools, after tools were leak next two-three months all countries were hit by ransomware called "**WANNACRY**", i woke up from bed got news from my friend and posts from Instagram about the ransomware so i started doing research and they say this ransomware is using an exploit that leak by NSA that is called "**ETERNALBLUE**" this exploit is the masterpiece for me it's like owning a lightsaber, this exploit is really good that for me successful rate for this exploit is like 9.0/10.0, when you use the "**FUZZBUNCH**" (like metasploit-framework but for the NSA hacking tool) its really nice. that time security researcher also build **ETERNALBLUE** module for metasploit-framework its not that good at that time, i also created my own internet scan to scan the device that vulnerable to **ETERNALBLUE**, the script is just generate random IP addresses and using existing **ETERNALBLUE** vulnerability scan i modify the code since its written in python to be able to scan random generated IP addresses.

so using my computer it didn't scan a lot since my home internet speed are slow that time so i have to use VPS, from there i started to learn on setting up Linux VPS and learn the commands, here are what i setup:
- a **ETERNALBLUE** scanner that scan random IP address on VPS
- i installed metasploit-framework on VPS to use the **ETERNALBLUE** exploit
- i also use **FUZZBUNCH** on my computer if metasploit-framework exploit unsuccessful

that time when i ran the scanner it started output the results of vulnerable windows devices such as computer and servers it's a lot, if im not wrong i still keep my scanner results somewhere. then i started to try the exploit on some of the vulnerable ip address, first i will try using metasploit-framework, when using metasploit-framework it will fail sometimes so i have to use **FUZZBUNCH** when using this framework i had to create DLL payload from **msfvenom**(metasploit-framework payload generator) but based on arch(x64/x86) of the target windows, then using **DOUBLEPULSAR**(another tool to inject dll after successful exploit and implementation of **DOUBLEPULSAR**) to inject dll, but i had to paste hex of the generated dll from msfvenom to inject the dll. it is a lot of works but using **FUZZBUCH** always successful.

after everything success and got **meterpreter** session on metasploit-framework, i started on looking inside the devices, fyi: i don't do damage to any of the system, what i did was hack it, post it on Instagram, and say im 1337 :D.. i was a teenage and stupid that time haha. so using metasploit-framework i learn how to pivot inside the network, routing, portforwarding, and sometimes i able to exploit another server inside the network by using pivot.

so that all with the introduction and my experience with the hacking stuff, now i started to get into penetration tester path, i've been doing some testing on web app & mobile app so keep checking out my blog for some research, how to.. idk what else should i post :D
